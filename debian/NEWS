nfs-utils (1:2.6.1-1~exp1ubuntu1) jammy; urgency=medium

    The configuration of the NFS related services has been moved to /etc/nfs.conf.
    This package still installs /etc/default/nfs-common and
    /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server, but they are ignored. A future version of this
    package will handle the migration somehow[1].
    .
    Due to the above, the old nfs-config.service unit file has been deprecated and
    removed.
    .
    All NFS related services are enabled by default. This means that depending on
    the NFS version that you intend to use, some services might be superfluous.
    For example, if you never intend to serve NFSv3, then you can safely disable
    the rpc-statd.service unit. Note that some NFSv4 service units will start
    only if Kerberos is setup.
    .
    libnfsidmapMAJOR and libnfsidmap-dev are now built from the nfs-utils source
    package. This change deprecates the source package src:libnfsidmap.
