nfs-utils (1:2.6.1-1ubuntu1) jammy; urgency=medium

    If there are local modifications to either /etc/default/nfs-common or
    /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server as installed by previous versions of
    the corresponding Debian packages, nfs-common will attempt a migration
    to the new configuration file. This migration is done by calling the
    /usr/share/nfs-common/nfsconvert.py script in postinst.
    .
    The new configuration file is /etc/nfs.conf, and the migration script will
    create /etc/nfs.conf.d/local.conf with the options defined in the old
    /etc/default/nfs-* configuration files. Therefore /etc/nfs.conf will
    contain the package defaults, and /etc/nfs.conf.d/local.conf the local
    customizations, overriding the defaults in nfs.conf.
    .
    If this migration fails for some reason, the package installation will
    also fail and manual intervention will be required.
    .
    This will probably involve temporarily removing the offending
    configuration option that was not handled by the migration script and
    configuring the package again. Please consult nfs.conf(5) and each
    daemon's manpage to determine how to translate the command line options
    previously defined in /etc/default/nfs-* to the new configuration file
    format.

nfs-utils (1:2.6.1-1~exp1ubuntu1) jammy; urgency=medium

    The configuration of the NFS related services has been moved to /etc/nfs.conf.
    This package still installs /etc/default/nfs-common and
    /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server, but they are ignored. A future version of this
    package will handle the migration somehow[1].
    .
    Due to the above, the old nfs-config.service unit file has been deprecated and
    removed.
    .
    All NFS related services are enabled by default. This means that depending on
    the NFS version that you intend to use, some services might be superfluous.
    For example, if you never intend to serve NFSv3, then you can safely disable
    the rpc-statd.service unit. Note that some NFSv4 service units will start
    only if Kerberos is setup.
    .
    libnfsidmapMAJOR and libnfsidmap-dev are now built from the nfs-utils source
    package. This change deprecates the source package src:libnfsidmap.
