The nfs-utils package in Ubuntu has been patched to reduce the default log
verbosity in the case of expired Kerberos credentials, for the reasons
described here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-utils/+bug/293705

Please consider applying the attached patch to Debian as well.

Andrew Pollock said he was submitting this patch upstream, but there doesn't
seem to be any evidence that it's been included yet in 1.2.0.
