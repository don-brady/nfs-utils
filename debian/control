Description: Kernel NFS server support
 Use this package if you have a fairly recent kernel (2.2.13 or better)
 and you want to use the kernel-mode NFS server.  The user-mode NFS
 server in the "nfs-user-server" package is slower but more featureful
 and easier to debug than the kernel-mode server.

Description: NFS benchmark program
 nhfsstone (pronounced n-f-s-stone, the "h" is silent) is used on a
 NFS client to generate an artificial load with a particular mix of
 NFS operations. It reports the average response time of the server
 in milliseconds per call and the load in calls per second. The
 program adjusts its calling patterns based on the client's kernel
 NFS statistics and the elapsed time. Load can be generated over a
 given time or number of NFS calls.
